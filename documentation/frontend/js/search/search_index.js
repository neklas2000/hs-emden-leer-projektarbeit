It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http delete request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.delete(':id', '1').subscribe(...); // Handle the subscription\n\n

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.
