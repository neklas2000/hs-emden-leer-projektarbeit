It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

It allows that a specific resource can be\nread from the database by sending a http request to the api. The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

The api endpoint is expected to\ncontain an id to specifiy which data record needs to be read precisely.\nRead a product with the id \"1\"\nExample :const connector = new JsonApiConnectorService('products');\n// ~> This sends a http get request to the route /api/v1/products/1\nconnector.read({ route: ':id', ids: '1' }).subscribe(...); // Handle the subscriptionwhich is the specific endpoint of the api. The route should consist of an id (e.g. \"/foo/:id\").\nIt is also possible to provide the id either as a string or a map of multiple ids if the\nroute consists of multiple ids. In order to reduce or extend the data requested from the api,\nit is possible to provide json api query options.\n\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                params\n                                            \n                                                            ReadParameters\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional object of optional arguments.

If no value for the route is\nprovided undefined will be returned and if no value for the ids is provided the route\nwill be returned. If both arguments are provided and the ids are of the type string it is\nexpected that the route includes the pattern \":id\". If it doesn't include the pattern an\nerror will be thrown. If ids is an object each key will be extended by a colon to find the\npattern.\nReplace the pattern \":id\" with an id\nExample :this.replaceIds('/users/:id', '1'); // ~> \"/users/1\"Replace multiple patterns for ids\nExample :this.replaceIds('/projects/:projectId/report/:reportId', { projectId: '123', reportId: '456' }); // ~> \"/projects/123/report/456\"\n\n                            \n                                Parameters :\n                                \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            Name\n                                                Type\n                                            Optional\n                                                Description\n                                        \n                                    \n                                    \n                                        \n                                                route\n                                            \n                                                            string\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    A optional route which could look like \":id\".\n\n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                                ids\n                                            \n                                                            RequestIds | string\n                                            \n\n                                            \n                                                    Yes\n                                            \n\n\n                                            \n                                                    An optional string or object of ids (e.g. { id: '1' }).\n\n                                            \n                                        \n                                    \n                                \n                            \n                        \n                            Returns :         Undefinable\n\n                        \n                            \n                                The route populated by the given ids.\n\n                            \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                    \n                    \n                        update\n                        \n                    \n                \n            \n            \n                \nupdate(route: string, ids: RequestIds | string, data: DeepPartial)\n                \n            \n\n\n                    \n                        \n                            Inherited from         JsonApiConnectorService\n\n                        \n                    \n                    \n                        \n                                Defined in         JsonApiConnectorService:204\n\n                        \n                    \n\n\n            \n                \n                        This function represents the CRUD operation \"Update\".
