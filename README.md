# HS Emden/Leer Project Work

This project has been developed during my studies at the University of Applied Sciences Emden/Leer.
It allows an user to monitor the project progress through a milestone trend analysis.

## Git Hooks

Please copy the script `pre-commit.sh` in this root folder to the folder `.git/hooks` so that all
tests are being executed when committing changes. Execute the following shell command
`cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit` to accomplish this.
