# IMPORTANT NOTICE

The folders `api` and `frontend` were part of the original project. They contain the entire project implementation, for which received a grade of 1.0 (4.0 GPA | A+).
The folders `server` and `client` are still work in progress. They contain a "new" approach to the project and its implementation, as well as new features.

If you came here to view this project for a portfolio, I encourage you to take a look at the original folders (`api` and `frontend`). However, please feel free to take a look at the other two folders as well.
