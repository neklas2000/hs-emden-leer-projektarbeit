   This function replaces id patterns within the provided route.

If both arguments are provided and the ids are of the type string it is\nexpected that the route includes the pattern \":id\". If it doesn't include the pattern an\nerror will be thrown. If ids is an object each key will be extended by a colon to find the\npattern.\nReplace the pattern \":id\" with an id\nExample :this.replaceIds('/users/:id', '1'); // ~> \"/users/1\"Replace multiple patterns for ids\nExample :this.replaceIds('/projects/:projectId/report/:reportId', { projectId: '123', reportId: '456' }); // ~> \"/projects/123/report/456\"\n\n                            \n

the provided route. If no value for the route is\nprovided undefined will be returned and if no value for the ids is provided the route\nwill be returned. If both arguments are provided and the ids are of the type string it is\nexpected that the route includes the pattern \":id\". If it doesn't include the pattern an\nerror will be thrown. If ids is an object each key will be extended by a colon to find the\npattern.\nReplace the pattern \":id\" with an id\nExample :this.replaceIds('/users/:id', '1'); // ~> \"/users/1\"Replace multiple patterns for ids\nExample :this.replaceIds('/projects/:projectId/report/:reportId', { projectId: '123', reportId: '456' }); // ~> \"/projects/123/report/456\"\n\n                            \n

route. If no value for the route is\nprovided undefined will be returned and if no value for the ids is provided the route\nwill be returned. If both arguments are provided and the ids are of the type string it is\nexpected that the route includes the pattern \":id\". If it doesn't include the pattern an\nerror will be thrown. If ids is an object each key will be extended by a colon to find the\npattern.\nReplace the pattern \":id\" with an id\nExample :this.replaceIds('/users/:id', '1'); // ~> \"/users/1\"Replace multiple patterns for ids\nExample :this.replaceIds('/projects/:projectId/report/:reportId', { projectId: '123', reportId: '456' }); // ~> \"/projects/123/report/456\"\n\n                            \n
